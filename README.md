# Refund Workflow Overview

This document outlines the complete workflow for processing refunds, ensuring traceability, compliance, and error resilience. The process is implemented using AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and supporting AWS services.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Retrieve Original Ledger Entry

- Query the `PaymentLedger` table using the `TransactionID`.
- Fetch all related entries (e.g., fees, taxes) for accurate refund processing.

### 2. Validate Refund Eligibility

- Ensure the transaction has been completed and is eligible for a refund.
- Check that the transaction is within the allowed refund time frame and has not already been refunded.

### 3. Revert Ledger Entries

- Create new entries in the `PaymentLedger` table to represent the refund.
- Adjust balances and account for associated fees, taxes, and multi-currency handling.
- Maintain traceability by linking refund entries to the original transaction.

### 4. Persist Payment Audit Trail

- Log all refund-related actions in the `PaymentAuditTrail` table.
- Include metadata such as:
  - Original transaction ID.
  - Refund amount.
  - Timestamp.
  - Initiator details (user/system).

### 5. Error Handling

- **Duplicate Refunds**: Prevent duplicate entries by checking for existing refunds.
- **Partial Refunds**: Track remaining refundable amounts for partial refunds.
- **Multi-Currency**: Handle currency conversions where applicable.
- **Chargeback Conflicts**: Detect and block refunds for chargeback-initiated transactions.
- **Ledger Consistency**: Validate all entries to prevent data inconsistencies.

### 6. Rollback Mechanism

- Implement a rollback process to correct errors in refund entries or audit logs.
- Ensure rollback operations maintain historical accuracy without altering past data.

### 7. Logging and Monitoring

- Log all refund attempts and actions, whether successful or failed.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor refund activities and flag unusual patterns.

### 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Test scenarios including:
  - Full refunds.
  - Partial refunds.
  - Multi-currency transactions.
  - Failed refund attempts (e.g., network errors).
- Validate data consistency and compliance with accounting standards.

### 9. Documentation

- Document APIs, error-handling scenarios, and ledger/audit processes.
- Provide clear guidelines for using the refund workflow.

## AWS Services Used

- **DynamoDB**: For persisting ledger and audit trail data.
- **Lambda**: To implement refund logic and workflows.
- **AWS KMS**: To encrypt sensitive data.
- **CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure compliance with applicable data protection and retention regulations.
- All sensitive data should be securely stored and masked where necessary.
