# Refund Workflow Overview

This document outlines the complete workflow for processing refunds, ensuring traceability, compliance, and error resilience. The process is implemented using AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and supporting AWS services.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Retrieve Ledger Entry for Refund Initiation

- Query the `PaymentLedger` table using the `TransactionID`.
- Fetch all related entries (e.g., payment, fees, taxes) to ensure an accurate refund calculation.
- Identify the ledger entry status (pending, completed) for refund eligibility.

### 2. Seek Refund and Validate Eligibility

- Ensure the transaction has been completed, is eligible for a refund, and is within the allowed refund time frame.
- Check that the transaction has not already been refunded and no conflicts exist (e.g., chargebacks).
  
### 3. Ledger Entries for Refund Pending

- Update the `PaymentLedger` table to represent a "Refund Pending" status.
- Adjust balances for the refund, accounting for associated fees and taxes, and ensure multi-currency support where applicable.

### 4. Create Ledger Entry for Payment Success

- On successful refund processing, create a "PAYMENT-SUCCESS" ledger entry.
- Record any related fees or adjustments, and track the refund amount.
  
### 5. Persist Payment Audit Trail

- Log all refund-related actions in the `PaymentAuditTrail` table.
- Include metadata such as:
  - Original transaction ID.
  - Refund amount.
  - Timestamp.
  - Initiator details (user/system).

### 6. Error Handling

- **Duplicate Refunds**: Prevent duplicate entries by checking for existing refunds.
- **Partial Refunds**: Track remaining refundable amounts for partial refunds.
- **Multi-Currency**: Handle currency conversions where applicable.
- **Chargeback Conflicts**: Detect and block refunds for chargeback-initiated transactions.
- **Ledger Consistency**: Validate all entries to prevent data inconsistencies.

### 7. Audit Trail of Ledger Entry Query and Response

- Maintain a log of all refund-related ledger entry queries and their responses.
- Ensure the audit trail accurately records the state of the transaction and any actions taken.

### 8. Rollback Mechanism

- Implement a rollback process to correct errors in refund entries or audit logs.
- Ensure rollback operations maintain historical accuracy without altering past data.

### 9. Normalize Processor Response

- Standardize responses from the payment processor to ensure consistency across the system.
- Map processor messages (success or failure) to standardized application responses.

### 10. Logging and Monitoring

- Log all refund attempts and actions, whether successful or failed.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor refund activities and flag unusual patterns.

### 11. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Test scenarios including:
  - Full refunds.
  - Partial refunds.
  - Multi-currency transactions.
  - Failed refund attempts (e.g., network errors).
- Validate data consistency and compliance with accounting standards.

### 12. Documentation

- Document APIs, error-handling scenarios, and ledger/audit processes.
- Provide clear guidelines for using the refund workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Retrieve Ledger Entries for Refund

1. Implement a method to retrieve ledger entries linked to the original transaction ID.
2. Include relevant entries (e.g., payment, fees, taxes).
3. Handle the case where the ledger entry is still pending.

### Validation Checks

1. Confirm refund eligibility based on status, policies, and time limits.
2. Ensure no prior refunds exist for the transaction.

### Revert Ledger Entries

1. Adjust balances for full or partial refunds.
2. Ensure taxes and fees are handled correctly.

### Create Ledger Entry for Payment Success

1. On successful refund, create a "PAYMENT-SUCCESS" ledger entry.
2. Adjust balances and record any related fees or taxes.

### Persist Payment Audit Trail

1. Log refund actions with metadata for traceability.
2. Link refund entries to original transactions.

### Data Integrity and Error Handling

1. Prevent duplicate refunds and maintain accurate ledger updates.
2. Handle multi-currency and chargeback scenarios appropriately.

## AWS Services Used

- **DynamoDB**: For persisting ledger and audit trail data.
- **Lambda**: To implement refund logic and workflows.
- **AWS KMS**: To encrypt sensitive data.
- **CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring.

# Refund Processing Lambda - API Response Examples

This document provides examples of the expected success and error responses when invoking the **Refund Processing Lambda** API.

## Success Response Example

If the refund is processed successfully, the Lambda will return the following response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": {
    "message": "Refund processed successfully.",
    "refund_transaction_id": "12345-REFUND",
    "status": "success",
    "processor_message": "Refund approved by processor."
  }
}
